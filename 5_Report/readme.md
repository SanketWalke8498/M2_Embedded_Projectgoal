# _Calculator_

## Introduction
Calculator, In this project the designed embedded system has been created.The circuit had being developed on simulIDE software platform by 
using Atmega328p microcontroller.In this project calculator has been made to perform addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

## Features
-   It is easier to get calculation in this project .
-   The expressions used are for addition "+",substraction "-",multiplication "*",and division "/" .
-   LCD display will show you the calculations done by you .
 ## Research
 There are complex calculator available in the market but for the start to learn its functions more simple form of calculator is required
 for this.
 
 ## Details Requirements
